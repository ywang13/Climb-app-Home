Here's a precise prompt to fix all the issues:

---

**Fix the Session Details Page bugs to match the original design and functionality.**

**Issues to fix:**

1. **Fix mobile viewport/resolution:**
   - The page should maintain mobile app dimensions (same as homepage)
   - Add proper viewport meta tag or CSS to ensure consistent mobile resolution
   - Width should match the homepage card width

2. **Fix media carousel functionality:**
   - Currently showing only one fixed image - make it swipeable
   - Implement proper carousel with all 3 media items from the session
   - Add swipe gesture support to navigate between media
   - Update the media index (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) when swiping

3. **Add missing media dots indicator:**
   - Add pagination dots at the bottom of the screen (above the expandable sheet)
   - White background strip with black/gray dots
   - Active dot should be black, inactive dots gray
   - Should update when swiping through media

4. **Add dark overlay for media counter:**
   - Add semi-transparent dark background behind the "1/3" indicator
   - Use rgba(0,0,0,0.5) or similar for better text visibility

5. **Fix expandable sheet tap functionality:**
   - Currently only responds to drag - add tap/click handler
   - Tapping anywhere on the collapsed sheet should expand it
   - Add click event listener in addition to drag

6. **Fix expandable sheet positioning:**
   - Sheet should start at the very bottom of the screen
   - In collapsed state: bottom edge at screen bottom, showing ~150px height
   - In expanded state: extend upward while bottom stays at screen bottom
   - No gap should exist between sheet and screen bottom
   - Media should not be visible under the sheet

**Implementation fixes needed:**

```css
/* Fix sheet positioning */
.bottom-sheet {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0; /* Anchored to bottom */
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  /* Remove any margin-bottom or transform that creates gap */
}

/* Media dots container */
.media-dots {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 150px; /* Above collapsed sheet */
  background: white;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  border-radius: 16px;
}
```

**Carousel implementation:**
- Use existing media array from session data
- Implement touch/swipe events or use a carousel library
- Sync carousel index with media counter and dots

Ensure all fixes maintain smooth animations and the exact design from the mockups.
