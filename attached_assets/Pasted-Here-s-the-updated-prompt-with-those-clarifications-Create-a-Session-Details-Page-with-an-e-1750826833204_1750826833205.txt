Here's the updated prompt with those clarifications:

**Create a Session Details Page with an expandable bottom sheet for climbing statistics.**

**Navigation Setup:**
1. Add React Router or similar navigation library
2. Make session cards on homepage clickable, navigating to `/session/:sessionId`
3. Pass session ID to the details page

**Page Structure:**

1. **Full-screen media viewer:**
   - Display session media (photos/videos) in a full-screen carousel
   - Show current media index indicator (e.g., "1/12") in top-right
   - Add climbing route grade badge with route color:
     - Display grade (e.g., "V5") in white text
     - **Circular colored background indicates the actual route hold color** (e.g., orange, blue, green, purple)
     - This color needs to be stored per media item
   - Include back button (←) in top-left corner
   - **Media dots indicator at bottom:** Show pagination dots (● ● ● ● ●) on white background strip
     - Active dot is black, inactive dots are gray
     - Shows current position in media carousel
   - Support swipe gestures to navigate between media
   - For videos, show play/pause controls

2. **Expandable bottom sheet with session details:**
   
   **Collapsed State (default):**
   - Shows only session title (e.g., "Morning session")
   - Date, time, and location (e.g., "March 21, 2025 at 5:44 PM • Santa Clara")
   - Drag handle indicator at top
   - Height: ~150px from bottom

   **Expanded State:**
   - Triggered by: tapping the sheet or dragging up
   - Shows all climbing statistics in a 2x2 grid:
     - Total send: 11
     - Routes climbed: 12
     - Hardest send: V8
     - Time: 1h 56m
   - Each stat has a label above and value below
   - Smooth animation when expanding/collapsing
   - Can be dismissed by dragging down

**Database/Schema Updates:**

1. **Update media table to include route information:**
   ```sql
   -- Add to media table:
   route_grade VARCHAR(10) -- e.g., "V5", "V10", "5.12a"
   route_color VARCHAR(20) -- e.g., "orange", "blue", "green", "purple"
   ```

2. **Update Media interface:**
   ```typescript
   interface Media {
     id: number;
     url: string;
     type: 'photo' | 'video';
     thumbnail_url?: string;
     duration?: number;
     route_grade?: string;  // NEW
     route_color?: string;  // NEW
   }
   ```

3. **Update InMemoryDatabase sample data:**
   - Add route_grade and route_color to sample media items
   - Use realistic climbing colors: "orange", "blue", "green", "purple", "yellow", "red", "black", "pink"

**Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Create SessionDetailsPage component:**
   ```typescript
   interface SessionDetailsProps {
     sessionId: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Fetch session data:**
   - Use existing GET `/api/sessions/:sessionId` endpoint
   - Include media array with route information

3. **Route color badge styling:**
   ```css
   /* Example for route grade badge */
   .route-badge {
     background-color: var(--route-color); /* Dynamic based on route_color */
     color: white;
     border-radius: 50%;
     padding: 8px 12px;
   }
   ```

4. **Media dots indicator:**
   - Position at bottom of screen above the bottom sheet
   - White background strip with padding
   - Dots change opacity/color based on active state
   - Maximum 5-6 dots visible, with scaling for more media

5. **Bottom sheet behavior:**
   - Use a library like `react-spring` or `framer-motion` for smooth animations
   - Implement drag gestures with touch/mouse support
   - Snap points: collapsed (~150px) and expanded (~300px)
   - Add backdrop blur when expanded

6. **Add hardest_send field to sessions:**
   - Add to sessions table (string, nullable)
   - Update schema and types accordingly

**Styling Requirements:**
- Route color badge has solid color background with white text
- Media dots on white background strip for visibility
- Dark overlay on media for better text visibility
- Rounded top corners on bottom sheet
- Smooth transitions between states

Make sure the page is fully functional with smooth animations and follows the design exactly as shown in the screenshots.
