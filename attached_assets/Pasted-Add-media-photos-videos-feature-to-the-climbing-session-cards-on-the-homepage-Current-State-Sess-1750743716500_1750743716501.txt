Add media (photos/videos) feature to the climbing session cards on the homepage.
Current State: Session cards show user info, location, title, and stats (total sends, routes climbed, time).
Goal: Add a horizontal scrollable media gallery to each session card showing photos/videos, as shown in the mockup.
Database Changes:

Create a new media table with columns:

id (primary key)
session_id (foreign key to sessions table)
url (string - URL to stored media)
type (enum: 'photo' or 'video')
thumbnail_url (string - for video thumbnails)
duration (integer - video duration in seconds, null for photos)
order_index (integer - for ordering media)
created_at (timestamp)



Schema Updates:

Update shared/schema.ts to include:

Media table definition
Media type interface
Update FeedSession interface to include media array



Backend Updates:

Update GET /api/feed endpoint to include media for each session:

json{
  "sessions": [{
    "id": "uuid",
    "user": {...},
    "location": "...",
    "title": "...",
    "stats": {...},
    "media": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "url": "https://...",
        "type": "photo",
        "thumbnail_url": null,
        "duration": null
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "url": "https://...",
        "type": "video", 
        "thumbnail_url": "https://...",
        "duration": 23
      }
    ]
  }]
}

Add new endpoint POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/media for uploading media (implement later)
Update storage.ts to:

Join media table when fetching sessions
Include media in getFeed query
Add sample media data to in-memory database



Frontend Updates:

Create MediaGallery component that:

Shows horizontal scrollable list of media thumbnails
Displays video duration overlay (e.g., "0:23") on video thumbnails
Each media item should be ~150px wide with 8px gap
Shows placeholder if no media exists


Update SessionCard component to:

Include MediaGallery between title and stats
Only show MediaGallery if session has media


Sample media for testing:

Use placeholder climbing images from Unsplash
Add 2-3 media items per session
Mix of photos and videos (use static images for video thumbnails)
Video durations between 10-60 seconds



Styling Requirements:

Media gallery height: ~200px
Rounded corners on media items
Video duration badge: white text on semi-transparent black background in top-right corner
Smooth horizontal scroll with no scrollbar visible
Touch-friendly scrolling for mobile

Make sure the media feature integrates seamlessly with the existing session cards without breaking current functionality.
