Here's a prompt to bypass authentication and show Toad1's profile with sample data:

---

**Temporarily bypass authentication on the profile page for testing and show Toad1's profile with sample climbing sessions.**

**Requirements:**

1. **Bypass Authentication:**
   - Comment out or temporarily disable authentication check on the profile page
   - Hardcode the profile to show data for username "Toad1" (user ID 1 - foranswer)
   - Add a comment like `// TODO: Re-enable authentication after testing`

2. **Update Toad1's Profile Data:**
   - Username: "Toad1" (update from alex_climber)
   - Height: 178cm
   - Reach: +2cm
   - Bio: "Documenting my ascent and falling. (Sorry, climbing has become my entire personality)"
   - Keep existing avatar

3. **Create Sample Sessions for Toad1:**
   Add these sessions to the database for user ID 1:

   **Session 1 - Today:**
   - Title: "the v2 in my gym is lit ðŸ”¥"
   - Location: "Movement Sunnyvale"
   - Total sends: 15
   - Routes climbed: 15
   - Hardest send: "V2"
   - Duration: 123 minutes (2h 3m)
   - 3 media items from existing climbing images

   **Session 2 - Yesterday:**
   - Title: "Morning session"
   - Location: "Movement Sunnyvale"
   - Total sends: 6
   - Routes climbed: 12
   - Hardest send: "V6"
   - Duration: 51 minutes
   - 2 media items

   **Session 3 - 3 days ago:**

   - Location: "Movement Santa Clara"
   - Total sends: 3
   - Routes climbed: 8
   - Hardest send: "V8"
   - Duration: 90 minutes
   - 4 media items

   **Session 4 - Last week:**
   - Title: "Endurance training"

   - Total sends: 25
   - Routes climbed: 30
   - Hardest send: "V4"
   - Duration: 180 minutes
   - 2 media items

4. **Profile Page Display:**
   - Show all sessions in the feed using the existing SessionCard component
   - Ensure proper ordering (most recent first)

Keep the authentication logic in place but commented out so it can be easily re-enabled later. The profile page should immediately show Toad1's data without requiring login.
